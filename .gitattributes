# Set default behavior to automatically normalize line endings
* text=auto

# Shell scripts must use LF line endings (Unix style)
*.sh text eol=lf

# Batch files should use CRLF line endings (Windows style)
*.bat text eol=crlf

# PowerShell scripts can use either, but LF is safer for cross-platform
*.ps1 text eol=lf
